            **Crossdev** in gentoo is a utility, that can create toolchain for **cross compilation**. But cross compilation has disadvantages:
        %ol
          %li You can't run compiled software if host processor does not support target arch.
          %li You should support toolchain build configuration for your program and for dependecies of your program, if it does not exist or broken.
        %p
          :markdown
            It is possible to avoid cross compilation by using chroot environment and emulator for target arch.
            For example [qemu emulator](http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page) has great support of **arm** and **mips** arch.

          Usage of inline functions in c90/c99 is not so trivial as it should be.
